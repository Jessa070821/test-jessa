# Research Concept & Direction

## Overview

This research investigates fundamental assumptions about version control systems, specifically challenging how developers conceptualize and interact with distributed version control workflows. While existing literature assumes that version control complexity is an inherent trade-off for distributed systems, we propose that this complexity stems from misaligned mental models rather than technical necessity.

**Research Problem**: Current version control systems optimize for technical correctness over cognitive alignment with developer mental models, leading to adoption barriers and workflow friction.

**Research Objective**: Develop and validate a framework for version control interaction design that prioritizes cognitive load reduction while maintaining distributed system benefits.

## Key Research Questions

### Primary Research Question
How can version control systems be redesigned to align with natural developer mental models while preserving distributed system advantages?

### Secondary Research Questions
1. **Assumption Inversion**: What if version control complexity is primarily a UX problem rather than a technical necessity?
   - Current assumption: Distributed systems are inherently complex
   - Alternative hypothesis: Complexity comes from interface design, not underlying architecture

2. **Tool Integration Paradigms**: How do modern development environments (like Cursor/AI-assisted coding) reshape version control interaction patterns?
   - Current assumption: Version control is separate from code editing
   - Alternative hypothesis: Integrated AI-assisted version control reduces cognitive overhead

3. **Mental Model Alignment**: What mental models do developers actually use when reasoning about code changes, and how do current VCS interfaces support or hinder these models?
   - Current assumption: Git's technical model matches developer thinking
   - Alternative hypothesis: Developer mental models are more file-centric and less commit-centric

## Methodology

### Research Approach: Assumption + Hypothesis Framework

Following the Computer Science-inspired methodology, this research employs the assumption inversion technique:

1. **Literature Analysis**: Identify prevailing assumptions in version control research and practice
2. **Assumption Mapping**: Document implicit beliefs about distributed systems, developer workflows, and tool integration
3. **Hypothesis Generation**: Propose inversions of these assumptions with testable predictions
4. **Empirical Validation**: Design experiments to test assumption inversions
5. **Impact Assessment**: Evaluate how findings reshape understanding of version control design

### Experimental Design Principles

**Standards of Evidence**: 
- **User Studies**: Quantitative metrics (task completion time, error rates) and qualitative analysis (mental model interviews)
- **Systems Evaluation**: Performance benchmarks for alternative interaction paradigms
- **Longitudinal Studies**: Adoption patterns and learning curves for new interaction models

**Vectoring Strategy**: Focus on the highest-risk assumption - that distributed version control complexity is technically necessary rather than a design choice.

### Expected Contributions

1. **Theoretical**: A framework for analyzing version control UX through assumption inversion
2. **Empirical**: Evidence for developer mental model misalignment with current VCS design  
3. **Practical**: Design principles for cognitively-aligned version control interfaces
4. **Methodological**: Reproducible approach for identifying high-impact assumptions in systems research

This research aims to reshape how we think about version control system design by challenging the fundamental assumption that distributed systems must be complex from a user perspective.
